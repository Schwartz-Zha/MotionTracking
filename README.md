# MotionTracking

## Description
This is an experimental project based on Helge Rhodin's 2015 paper [A Versatile Scene Model with Differentiable Visibility
Applied to Generative Pose Estimation](http://gvv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/DiffVis/index.html). I developed the work within a VIRS progrom under Prof. Rhodin's guidance.

This project is developed mainly with Python, PyTorch, and MPII dataset, the detailed requirements will be listed in Requirements section.

The first trial is based on the 'fake' human pose dataset, the reason for doing this will be discussed later. All data arrangement and codes are put under the 'toy' directory.
